# Rose and the Old Castle of Twilight

Mostly concerned with extracting data from [Rose and the Old Castle of Twilight](http://nippon1.jp/consumer/rose/), and will probably work with games that use similar formats, such as Yomawari.

`fad_ex.py` extracts and converts the graphics stored in .fad archives.

## Games Tested

* Rose and the Old Castle of Twilight (Vita)

## Notes
